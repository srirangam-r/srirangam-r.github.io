description: For my Control Systems course project, I simulated an Acrobot in Drake and designed and implemented controllers for it based on the original paper by Spong using energy shaping and LQR. Code and more details can be found <a href='https://github.com/srirangam-r/acrobot_swingup'>here</a>. Won the vote for the best project in the class.
