description: Currently working on Husky, a quadrupedal robot that can both walk and fly. I developed a multimodal path planner for the robot and tested it using simscape multibody. I also started working on a Reinforcement Learning training for Husky using IsaacLab to traverse challenging environments using its legs and thrusters.
