description: "<p>For our undergrad final project, we developed a fully autonomous swab testing system. This project has 3 main subsystems:</p>
  <p>1. A nostril detection system - Trained an object detection model with a custom-made dataset with over 30,000 images from 47 people using yolov5 and ran it on an Xbox Kinect to detect the position of nostrils with an mAP of 86.9%.</p>
  <p>2. Manipulation - Restored an old Mitsubishi RV-M1 and designed a control circuit to control the arm using ROS and Moveit.</p>
  <p>3. Compliant design - Designed and fabricated a 3 jaw compliant gripper with force feedback to detect when the swab hits the nasal walls and safely channel the swab through the nasal cavity using impedance control</p>
  <p>Thw whole system was running on an Nvidia Jetson TX2. You can read more about this project in my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16zXyAnVcTt-DmsoWMEf8eCqAczfnzF2o2qk0vAvZb1A/edit?usp=sharing\">thesis</a>.</p>"
