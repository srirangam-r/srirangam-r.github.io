description: "<p>I implemented dead reckoning using IMU data with GPS data as the ground truth. I wrote ROS2 drivers for a GPS puck and a VN100 IMU and collected datasets driving in Northeastern's autonomous car, NUance. I performed Allan variance test to characterize the IMU's noise, calibrated the magnetometer and applied a complementary filter to process the IMU data.</p>
  <p>This work along with image stitching were done as part of the coursework for Robotics sensing and navigation and can be found <a href='https://github.com/srirangam-r/EECE5554-Robot-Sensing-and-Navigation'>here</a>. </p>"
