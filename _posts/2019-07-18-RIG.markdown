description: Robotics Interest Group (RIG) NITC is a student club of Robotics enthusiasts working on various research projects, competitions and holding expos and workshops to teach Robotics. As a part of RIG, I led two research projects - Quadruped and Garbage sorting robot. I designed and fabricated a novel quadruped with legs designed based on a delta robot, enhancing stability. I developed and trained a custom dataset for sorting recyclable and non recyclable garbage using RCNN and yolov3. I also led the 2021 Robocon team to make an arrow throwing robot.
