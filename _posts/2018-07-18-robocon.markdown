description: "<p>I was the team captain of our <strong>ABU Robocon 2021</strong> team where we designed and fabricated two mobile robots – one manual and the other autonomous – to move through an arena, picking up arrows and precisely throwing them into pots. More details about the design can be found in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14s6vHlBi_3uRdRsnJtOFdxnsnyQ1FI9r/view?usp=drive_link\">this document</a>.</p>"
