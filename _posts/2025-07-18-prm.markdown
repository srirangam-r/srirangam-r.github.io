description: A multimodal path planning algorithm for a robot that can walk and fly for the path of least power/time for a given environment. Works by extending a standard PRM to sample walking and flying nodes separately with edge costs as the approximate power/time and running the Bellman-ford algorithm to find the best path. Currently working on validating the planner in a Simscape environment and also trying out more efficient sampling methods.
