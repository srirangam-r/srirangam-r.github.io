description: "Put together a hardware demo for <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09777'>Contingency MPPI</a>. The goal of the robot was to hide from an adversary once a contingency is triggered. The robot localizes itself, creates a costmap of the environment, raytraces the FOV of the adversary and plans in a way that guarantees a cantingency trajectory for one of the safe zones at all times. The entire demo was done using a AgileX scout mini with an onboard NUC."
