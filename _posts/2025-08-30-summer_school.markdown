description: "This project was a collaboration with Universal Robots as a part of the Robotics Summer School. We developed a deep imitation learning framework to approximate a time-optimal motion planner <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07239'>(TOPP-RA)</a> with a neural network. Using the DAgger (Dataset Aggregation) algorithm, the system improved policy robustness by continuously incorporating corrections from the expert planner when encountering unseen states. The learned policy was deployed and validated on a 6-DOF UR5e robotic manipulator via ROS 2, where it achieved execution speeds comparable to the expert planner, even under varying object masses not present in training."
